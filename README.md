Automatas-using-C++
Implementing Finite Automatas using C++ Programming. All of us who have studied Automata and Compiler Design in our Computer Science course know that this course 
has caused all of us a lot of sleepless nights and existensial crisis :P . But it does not have to be this way. When you slow down and try to understand the 
underlying concepts, you come to a realisation that Automatas are a way to implement computer programs. They represent the path that your program can take and provide 
an in depth analysis of the same. Using them you can understand how computing works on a low machine level. Developing logic using automatas makes writing code 
afterwards easier. 
Sadly they are very limited. Pushdown Automatas accept a lot of other languages using stacks. They will also be added shortly... Stay tuned....

The aim of this repository is to inspire some interest in Automatas by seeing them work practically in front of you.
